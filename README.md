This is the code I used for my bachelor thesis on verifying the time stability of the ratio of the branching fractions of $B^+ \to \bar{D}^0\pi^+$ and $B^+ \to J/\psi K^+$ in 2024 LHCb data. The Jupyter notebook with the Python code can be found in the `Notebook-clean.ipynb` file.

The code itself could do with further modularization and optimization, but it is functional in its current state nonetheless. The data is not provided on this repository.
